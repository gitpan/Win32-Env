Revision history for Win32-Env

0.02    2006-10-06
	- Removed "print"s accidentally forgotten in BroadcastEnv().
	- Switch GetEnv()/SetEnv() to object interface to Win32::TieRegistry
          from tied hash. That way there will be no problems with symbols
          that are registry delimiters in variable names.
        - Added ListEnv() and DelEnv().
        - Improved documentation.
	- Added checks to ensure that variable name passed to functions
          is defined and non-empty.
        - Added error-handling-arguments.t - tests to check that functions
          properly complain about lack of or bad arguments.
